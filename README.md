# Stardew Valley Expanded Production (SVEP)
SVEP is a mod for the player who wants to be able to do more with his or her
farm.  Selling crops to Pierre or dumping them in a magic sell-chest is great,
but what if you could do more?  What if you could make things with all the
high quality crops grown on your farm?  This is the problem to be tackled by
the mod.  There are several long-term goals for the mod, including skills and
minigames for each of the major features; however, to begin, the primary goals
are listed below.  Please note, you _will_ become Pam's best friend by 
installing this mod.

## First Steps

1. Brewery
  The brewery will be a placeable, upgradeable, leveled building constructed
by the Valley's favorite redheaded carpenter.  In the brewery, you will be able
to brew large volumes of consumable beers, ales, and ciders using the crops
grown on your farm.  Combining the ingredients in specific ratios will not only
affect which product you'll be producing, but also affect the quality of the
hooch coming out of the barrel.  Once brewed, the alcohol can be sold for a 
profit proportional to the type and quality of the product, or consumed for
energy.  Experiment and discover unique combinations of value and side-effects.

2. Winery
  The winery, much like the brewery, will be a placeable, upgradeable, leveled
building.  You will be able to brew large volumes of consumable wines and meads
using the crops grown on your farm.  Combining the ingredients in specific 
ratios will affect which product being produced and will affect the quality of
the wine coming out of the barrel.  Once brewed, the alcohol can be sold for a 
profit proportional to the type and quality of the product, or consumed for
energy.  Experiment and discover unique combinations of value and side-effects.

3. Distillery
  The distillery will function similarly to the brewery and winery.  Instead
of bringing crops to the distillery, you will have the opportunity to distill,
age, and/or filter your craft beers, wines, and meads into whiskeys, brandies, 
vodkas, and honey rums.  If you include some botanicals in the distillation 
process, gins become possible, as well as the discovery of additional
properties that can be imparted to the spirit.  Experimentation leads to 
delightful inebriation.

4. Bakery
  Steering away from alcohol, your farm is a magical place where everything
you could possibly need to make wonderous breads, cakes, pies, and treats can
grow and be produced in abundance and quality.  Why shouldn't you dabble in 
the joy baking?  The baked goods produced in the bakery differ from those 
available in your home kitchen by way of quality.  It will take more 
ingredients, an understanding of methods and ratios, and some patience; 
however, the rewards will be worth it.  Valuable baked goods your neighbors
will love, satisfying and mystical treats to help get you through the day or
those last couple levels of the mines, and a little bit of real-life knowledge
on baking!

5. Creamery
  Your cows work hard.  You do a lot to love them, and they give you lots of 
fresh, delicious milk in the process.  Use the creamery to turn that milk into
creams, butters, and larger amounts of cheese for increased profit and making
ingredients for use in other areas (**cough** the bakery).  Age your cheese to
increase its quality, just like in the base game, only at higher rates and 
without taking up valuable basement space.

## Next Steps

1. Skills
  - Brewer
  - Vintner
  - Distiller
  - Baker
  - Churner

2. Inebriation
  You shouldn't be able to chug bottles and bottles of the good stuff without
consequence, and making those consequences affect gameplay _will_ be on the 
to-do list as soon as the more important features are working.  This will 
affect dialogue with NPCs, make it harder to move, harder to fish, and affect 
gameplay visuals to highlight your bad decision-making.

3. Town Events
  Congratulations!  You just created an entire industry on your farm in Stardew
Valley.  I'm sure you'll want to be able to profit off of this more than just
going back to dropping your goods into the sell-chest or selling them to 
Pierre, so you might want to talk to Mayor Lewis about scheduling a tasting 
event, facilities tours, or town bake-off.  You'll need a dedicated event space
on your farm to accommodate the in-flow of guests, but you will be well
rewarded!  Depending on the frequency of these events, what you present, and 
the quality and variety of product on display, Gus may want to use you as a 
supplier for the Stardrop Saloon, or you'll just make some good money from 
friends and neighbors buying up your wares and partying the night away.

4. The Tax Man
  Thought you could get away from the Tax Man, eh?  Think again.  Every ounce
of liquor made needs to be accounted for at the end of the month, and if you
don't have the cash, your alcohol facilities will be locked down until you can
pay what you owe.  Much to his dismay, Mayor Lewis needs to make sure you are
being above-board with your new business, so on the off chance you can't pay
on the evening of day 28, you'll need to pay the good Mayor a visit with a 
check in hand to settle any outstanding debts.  Each subsequent offense will
increase the fines added atop the amount owed and prolong the period for which 
your establishments will be closed.  Beginning on the first of the month, your 
alcohol-producing buildings will be locked and you will be unable to collect
profits from the production of alcohol until you pay back what is owed.  The
longer you wait, the more you pay, the more likely your products will spoil.
This lock will not go away until debts are settled.  That is to say, you can't 
just blow up your breweries and build new ones.
